# quakes

Quakes is a Jupyter Notebook that began as an effort to look more closely at a [series of quakes](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/13-earthquakes-rattle-the-East-Bay-over-the-last-12701672.php) around Diablo CA in February 2018. But the generated plots should display correctly for any csv pulled from USGS.
